Digitize Welcome Desk | DBI Chat Bot Project\n<p>As a company, David’s Bridal decided to leverage opportunities around interacting with customer appointments to help better serve her through text message communications allowing her to interact with stores about their appointments. As a company, David’s Bridal has elected to focus our <em>Continuous Improvement Effort</em> by committing to leveraging new opportunities available to us by enhancing our customers experience when it comes to Appointments. In this project teams across all practice areas are collectively leveraging Text Messaging and the interactive services available to us through our strategic partner Liveperson. Once completed customers will have the option to be reminded of their appointment, confirm their commitment to their appointment, check in when arriving at their appointment, and interact with a stylist about their appoint at the store their appointment is scheduled at. Additionally, customers with virtual appointments will be handled with the same level service less checking in for theri virtual appointment. </p>\n\n<p>Digitizing <b><em>Welcome Desk</em></b> Experience is certain to capture more walk-ins, strengthen customer loyalty, and so much more - increase Net Promoter Score (NPS). </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>ChatBot:</b> Pre-Appt Msg: confirm appt info, reschedule, click for directions, completing myCustomer profile, chat 1:1 with store; Appt Status Msg: check-in via text, notification when stylist is available</li>\n\t<li><b>Kiosk</b>: Check-in: customers with an appt can quickly let us know she’s here; Walk-in: capture walk-in customer’s information digitally</li>\n\t<li><b>Streamline Process</b>: <em>Open availability view*, Approximate wait times*, Virtual queue, Notify stylist when appt arrives*</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n",
